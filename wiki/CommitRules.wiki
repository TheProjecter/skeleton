= Commit Rules =

These parameters must be met before committing to the trunk.

=== Unit Tests ===

  * If new code was created, unit tests must be created for that code.
  * All unit tests pertaining to the changed code must be tested, and passed.

=== PHPDoc Headers/Comments ===

  * Valid PHPDoc file headers must be created for any new code.
  * Valid PHPDoc file headers must be created for any code changed that did not already have them.
  * PHPDoc file headers must be updated to reflect any changes made.
  * Valid PHPDoc comments must be created for any new or edited classes, methods, or public class variables.

=== Log Message ===

  * Prefix your message with the class/folder your changes apply to enclosed in square brackets.  For example: "_[[A_Db_Recordset_MySQL]] Did something blah blah..._", or "_[[A_Db]] Did something else..._".
  * Provide a thorough description of what changes were made.  Separate items with new lines.
  * Avoid committing changes to more than one class at a time, the exception being if the changes depend on each other.

=== Syntax Standards ===

At this point, the PEAR Codesniffer standard to check against has not been yet decided.  Until then, check with Zend, and ignore any line length or tab errors.

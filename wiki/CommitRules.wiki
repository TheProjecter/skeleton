These parameters must be met before committing to the trunk.

  * If new code was created, unit tests must be created for that code.
  * All unit tests pertaining to the changed code must be tested, and passed.
  * Valid PHPDoc file headers must be created for any new code.
  * Valid PHPDoc file headers must be created for any code changed that did not already have them.
  * PHPDoc file headers must be updated to reflect any changes made.
  * Valid PHPDoc comments must be created for any new or edited classes, methods, or public class variables.

All these conditions must be met *before* committing.

At this point, the PEAR Codesniffer standard to check against has not been yet decided.  Until then, check with Zend, and ignore any line length or tab errors.

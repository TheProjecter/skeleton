This document gives the required standards for committing to the repository.  This is a useless piece of code demonstrating the various standards to be followed:

= The Breakdown =

  * Each page should start with a full opening PHP tag (<?php)
  * The top of the page has a document-level PHPDoc header, containing at least the file name, @package, @license, @link, and @author.
  * After a single empty line is the class-level PHPDoc comment, containing at least the class name and a description.
  * Immediately following is the class.  All extends and implements keywords are on the same line.  The opening hash is on the next line, at the same indentation.
  * Following that is an empty line at the same indentation.
  * Tabs should always be used for indentation, and should only be used for indentation.
  * Next is all class properties.  They should be grouped and sorted according to their type (static before instance, public before protected before private).  Groups of a certain type should be separated by an empty line.
  * Method/property keywords should be in this order: exposure (static?) variablename.  (e.x. public static $variable or public static $variable = 'hello').
  * All class properties should be formatted in camelCase (e.x. $someVariable, $someOtherVariable).
  * Private property variables should be prefixed with an underscore.
  * All empty lines in the code should be indented _as if there was code present_.
  * The constructor is the first method.
  * There should be parentheses directly after the method name, with no spacing between them.
  * Method arguments should be separated by a comma and a space, in that order.
  * Default arguments should _not_ be spaced (e.x. $arg='hello').
  * All method names should be clear and descriptive of what the method does.  They must be intuitive, and use *full words*.
  * The position of the opening hash relative to the method is the same as a class.
  * Control structures should have a space between the keyword (e.x. if, while, for, etc.) and the parentheses, spacing between logical operators (e.x. ||, &&, etc.) and expressions, and a space between the closing parentheses and the opening hash.
  * If the logic is too long, it can be wrapped and put on the next line, indented one level.
  * Method PHPDoc comments should give a clear description of the method, and list all parameters and the return value type (and optionally an explanation
  * Logical NOT (!) should not have a space between it and the thing being "NOT"ed.

<h1>A_Controller_PathInfo</h2>

<p>This class maps PATH_INFO values onto request vars using an array that describes the mappings. The array in in the format of the following example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-php"><code>$map = array(
	'' => array(		// '' is the route array used when no match is found
		'controller',		// position in PATH_INFO and requestprotected to map onto
		'action',
		'id',
		),
	'date' => array(	// if 'date' is found in the first element of PATH_INFO use the map below
		'' => array(
			'controller',
			'year',
			'month',
			'day',
			),
		),
	);
</code></pre>

<p>The mapper starts at the root level of the array and searches keys for a match on the first element in the PATH_INFO. If a key match is found it then uses the array under that key to search the next element in PATH_INFO. If no match is found then the [''] index in the array is used.  Every array should have a [''] key containing the route array to use to map PATH_INFO to Request vars.</p>

<p>In the example above, the PATH_INFO of "/view/person/Bob/" will map to the Request as "?controller=view&action=person&id=Bob" because 'view' does not match a key in the root array of the map, in this map that is '' and 'date'. The [''] array at the level where no match was found is used for the mapping. The PATH_INFO of "/date/2006/January/1st/" will map to the Request as "?controller=date&year=2006&month=January&day=1st" because 'date' matches a key in the map.</p>

<p>Additional parameters in the PATH_INFO past those defined in the map with be combined in pairs to request vars. For example, /view/person/Bob/age/42/height/84/ will map the the Reqest as "?controller=view&action=person&id=Bob&age=42&height=84". This can be turned off with the $map_extra_param_pairs parameter.</p>

<p>The position where mapping stopped is saves so additional maps can be applied to PATH_INFO. For example, the Front Http might map the first two values in PATH_INFO to the default /controller/action/ parameters. Different dispatched controllers may then set their own maps to map the parameters in PATH_INFO starting at the third parameter.</p>

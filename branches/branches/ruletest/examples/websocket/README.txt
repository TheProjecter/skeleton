Instructions

This example demonstrates setting up a WebSocket server and client in Skeleton Framework.  Before proceeding, you must confirm you have sockets installed/enabled in your PHP installation.  phpinfo() will tell you.  If it is not enabled, google "php enable sockets".

Running demo

Step 1.
	Open a terminal and chdir/cd to the location of this example.

Step 2.
	Start the server daemon by typing: php server.php

Step 3.
	Open index.html in the latest version of Chrome/Chromium or Firefox 4b8+ (does not have to be on localhost)

It is finished.

The demo is now running.  Note that this can be run on a computer without a server installed, as long as it has PHP.  This is because this library acts as a server, instead of depending on Apache/ISS/another server.  It writes and reads directly to the TCP connection.

Enjoy!
